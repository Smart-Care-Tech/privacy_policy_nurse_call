# Nurse Call privacy policy notice

To give you the best `Nurse Call` experience, the following information may be stored on your device only:
* Your username, so your colleagues can identify it is you.
* The floor you work on during your shift, so you only get information that is important to you right now.
* The host url, to connect you to SmartCareTech's in-house AI nurse call system.

This information will be deleted if you uninstall the `Nurse Call` app.
On Android devices, you can also delete this data in the general Settings on your device.
Choose Applications, Application manager or Installed Apps, scroll down to `Nurse Call` and tap Clear data or Clear cache.

This data will not be stored on SmartCareTech servers.

### Voice data

This is necessary if you want to remotely communicate with the residents of the nursing home.
Data is never stored. Neither on the phone nor on any server.

### What happens if you delete the app?
By uninstalling the app, all `Nurse Call` app data stored on your device will be removed.
